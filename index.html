    <p class="border">Hi my name is Bill and i would like to talk to you about Mandelbrot Caligraphy. First off I was drawn to Mendelbrot, because on its intrinsic, and mesmorizing style which includes,
      but not limited to ornate cursive style, as used by Penman, Engrossers, Illuminators, and Flourishers, which has been varied title's
      people like myself have been called throughout the centuries. I started developing a passion for this about 8 years ago. I started off with basic cursive styles, 
      blackletter alphabet, all the way to modern styles. </p>

     <p class="border"> Mandelbrot Caligraphy is a mystery til you really get into it, its a form of beautiful writing. it gives you a feeling of mystic with the repitions as you look 
      further and further into piece. This form of writing can be easily confused with its art alternative as it uses different styles, and requires different tools to create.
      There are 2 different associations with Mabrot, Ornate Pictorial, and Caligraphy. </p>
